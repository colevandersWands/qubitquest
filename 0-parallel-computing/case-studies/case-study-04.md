## Why Classical Optimization Fails at Scale

<details>
<summary><strong>The Combinatorial Explosion Problem</strong></summary>

**Mathematical Constraints**:

- **Possible routes**: 100,000! possible orderings of delivery locations
- **Vehicle assignment**: 5,000^100,000 ways to assign locations to vehicles
- **Total combinations**: Effectively infinite search space
- **Classical limitation**: Can explore <0.001% of possible solutions

**Current Algorithm Performance**:

- **Solution quality**: 85% efficiency (15% waste in routes)
- **Computational cost**: $50,000/day in AWS compute for optimization
- **Constraints handled**: Basic capacity and time windows
- **Advanced constraints**: Cannot optimize for real-time traffic, weather, driver
  preferences

**Business Consequences**:

- **Delivery delays**: 8% of deliveries arrive late due to suboptimal routes
- **Fuel waste**: 15% excess fuel consumption from inefficient routing
- **Customer satisfaction**: 82% on-time delivery rate (industry target: 95%)
- **Competitive disadvantage**: Slower response to same-day delivery requests
