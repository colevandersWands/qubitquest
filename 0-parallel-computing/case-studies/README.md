## Learning Objectives

Through these case studies, you will learn to:

- **Identify Parallel Computing Limits**: Recognize when classical parallel approaches hit
  fundamental bottlenecks
- **Evaluate Business Impact**: Quantify the cost of computational limitations in real
  business contexts
- **Assess Quantum Opportunities**: Evaluate when quantum computing might provide
  meaningful advantages
- **Develop Decision Frameworks**: Create systematic approaches for quantum vs. classical
  technology decisions
- **Professional Communication**: Articulate quantum value propositions to technical and
  business stakeholders

## Key Patterns

**When Quantum Computing Shows Promise**:

- Exponential search spaces (portfolio optimization, logistics routing)
- Natural quantum systems (molecular simulation, materials science)
- High-dimensional feature spaces (machine learning, pattern recognition)
- Combinatorial optimization problems with complex constraints

**When Classical Parallel Computing Remains Superior**:

- High-throughput, low-latency requirements
- Well-understood, optimized algorithms
- Cost-sensitive applications where "good enough" suffices
- Deterministic requirements (debugging, reproducible research)

## Professional Decision Framework

Each case study demonstrates the **Five-Question Quantum Assessment**:

1. **Problem Structure**: Does the problem involve exponential complexity?
2. **Business Value**: Is the potential improvement worth 10-100x cost increase?
3. **Technology Readiness**: Does current quantum hardware support the problem size?
4. **Risk Tolerance**: Can you afford uncertain development timelines?
5. **Competitive Landscape**: What's the strategic impact of quantum adoption?

These case studies prepare you to confidently evaluate quantum computing opportunities in
professional contexts, moving beyond theoretical understanding to practical business
decision-making.
