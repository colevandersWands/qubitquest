```

**Performance Characteristics**:

- **Accuracy**: 94.2% (missing 5.8% of fraud)
- **False positive rate**: 2.1% (blocks legitimate transactions)
- **Latency**: 0.8ms average (meets <100ms requirement)
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling up to current volume

## The Fundamental Limitation

<details>
<summary><strong>Why Classical ML Plateaued</strong></summary>

**Feature Space Explosion**:

- **Transaction features**: 500+ attributes per transaction
- **Interaction features**: 500^2 = 250,000 possible feature combinations
- **Temporal features**: 7-day history adds 500 × 7 = 3,500 time-series features
- **Total feature space**: >250,000 dimensions

**Classical ML Constraints**:

- **Curse of dimensionality**: Classical algorithms struggle with >1,000 features
- **Training data requirements**: Need 10^6 samples per feature (impossible scale)
- **Model complexity**: Ensemble size limited by latency requirements
- **Local optima**: Gradient descent gets stuck in suboptimal solutions

**Business Impact**:

- **Missed fraud**: 5.8% × $10B annual volume = $580M potential losses
- **False positives**: 2.1% × $10B = $210M in blocked legitimate transactions
- **Customer friction**: Each false positive costs $50 in customer service

**Hybrid Quantum-Classical Pipeline**:

```
Transaction -> Classical        -> Quantum Feature -> Quantum      -> Classical

- **Training approach**: Variational quantum circuits optimized via classical loop
- **Integration**: Quantum processing for complex cases, classical for simple ones
- **Latency target**: 2ms average (still well under 100ms requirement)

**Resource Requirements**:

- **Quantum hardware**: IBM Quantum Network or Amazon Braket (~$50K/month)
- **Development team**: 3 quantum ML engineers (6-month project)
- **Classical integration**: Existing infrastructure + quantum API calls
- **Total investment**: $2M development + $600K/year operational

**Projected Improvements**:

- **Accuracy**: 96.8% fraud detection (2.6% improvement)
- **False positive rate**: 1.4% (0.7% improvement)
- **Business value**: 2.6% improvement = $150M saved annually

## Technical Risk Assessment

<details>
<summary><strong>Quantum Computing Limitations</strong></summary>

**Current Technology Constraints**:

- **Noise limitations**: NISQ-era quantum computers have limited coherence time
- **Gate fidelity**: Current quantum gates have ~99.5% fidelity (error accumulation)
- **Measurement overhead**: Quantum state preparation and readout adds latency
- **Classical simulation**: May be achievable with advanced classical techniques

**Operational Risks**:

- **Availability**: Quantum computers not yet available 24/7/365
- **Scalability**: Unclear how quantum advantage scales with transaction volume
- **Integration complexity**: Quantum systems require specialized expertise
- **Regulatory approval**: Financial regulators may require extensive validation

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- **Hybrid approach**: Quantum for complex cases, classical for routine transactions
- **Redundancy**: Multiple quantum vendors to avoid single point of failure
- **Gradual rollout**: A/B testing with small percentage of transactions
- **Fallback systems**: Classical models remain operational during quantum maintenance
