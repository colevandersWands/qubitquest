## Next Steps

After completing this module's resources, you'll be prepared to:

1. **Recognize Classical Limitations**: Identify when parallel computing approaches hit
   fundamental bottlenecks
2. **Evaluate Technology Trade-offs**: Make informed decisions about when quantum
   computing might provide advantages
3. **Communicate with Stakeholders**: Explain parallel computing limitations and quantum
   possibilities to business and technical audiences
4. **Professional Development**: Pursue advanced study in quantum computing with solid
   foundational understanding

The resources above provide both theoretical understanding and practical experience with
parallel computing limitations, setting the foundation for understanding why quantum
computing offers different (not just faster) approaches to certain computational problems.
