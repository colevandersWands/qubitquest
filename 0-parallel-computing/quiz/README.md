## Learning Objectives

After completing these quizzes, you should be able to:

- Apply Amdahl's Law to calculate realistic speedup limits
- Identify communication and memory bottlenecks in parallel systems
- Recognize when exponential problem complexity breaks parallel approaches
- Make professional arguments about when quantum computing might provide advantages
- Distinguish between problems suited for parallel vs. quantum approaches

These concepts prepare you for understanding why quantum computing offers different (not
just faster) solutions to certain computational problems.
