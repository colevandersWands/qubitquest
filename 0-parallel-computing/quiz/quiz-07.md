# Quiz 7: Professional Reality Check

**Scenario**: You're presenting to your CTO about why the company should invest in quantum
computing research.

Based on this module, which argument is most compelling?

---

<details>
<summary><strong>A: Quantum computers are exponentially faster than classical computers</strong></summary>

✖ Nope.

This is quantum mysticism. Quantum computers aren't universally faster - they're
different.

For many problems (like simple arithmetic), classical computers are much faster. The
advantage is specific to certain problem types.

<details>
<summary><strong>B: We've hit the limits of Moore's Law, so we need quantum</strong></summary>

✖ Nope.

Moore's Law limitations affect single-core performance, but parallel computing still
offers scaling opportunities for many problems.

This doesn't explain why quantum computing specifically is needed.

<details>
<summary><strong>C: Our optimization problems have exponential search spaces that break even massive parallel computing clusters, and quantum algorithms could provide quadratic improvements for these specific use cases</strong></summary>

✔ Correct!

This shows professional understanding:

- Identifies specific business problems (optimization)
- Acknowledges limitations of current parallel approaches
- Realistic about quantum advantages (quadratic, not exponential)
- Focuses on specific use cases, not general claims

This demonstrates the critical thinking that quantum-literate professionals need.

<details>
<summary><strong>D: Quantum computing will replace all our current infrastructure</strong></summary>

✖ Nope.

This shows misunderstanding of quantum computing's role. Quantum computers are specialized
tools for specific problems.

Most computing tasks (databases, web servers, etc.) will remain classical for the
foreseeable future.
