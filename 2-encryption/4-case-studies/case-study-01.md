## The Quantum Threat Reality

<details>
<summary><strong>How Quantum Computers Break Current Security</strong></summary>

**Shor's Algorithm Impact**:

- **RSA-4096 vulnerability**: Quantum computer with 4,000 logical qubits can factor RSA
  keys in hours
- **Timeline threat**: IBM roadmap shows 4,000+ qubit systems by 2030
- **Retroactive decryption**: Adversaries store encrypted communications now, decrypt
  later
- **Complete cryptographic failure**: All RSA/ECC-based security becomes useless

**Intelligence Assessment**:

- **China's quantum program**: $15B investment, targeting cryptographically relevant
  quantum computers by 2030
- **Current vulnerability window**: 5-10 years before large-scale quantum attacks
- **Data sensitivity**: Military communications require 25+ year confidentiality
- **Strategic risk**: Loss of communication security = national security vulnerability

**Business Impact**:

- **Contract cancellation risk**: $2B defense contracts require quantum-safe security
- **Competitive disadvantage**: Competitors already developing quantum-safe solutions
- **Regulatory compliance**: NIST post-quantum cryptography mandates for government
  contractors
- **Reputation damage**: Security breach would eliminate future government business

## Discussion Questions

1. **Risk vs Cost**: Is the 3x cost increase for QKD justified by the security improvement
   for government communications?

2. **Implementation Strategy**: Should SecureGov deploy post-quantum algorithms first or
   go directly to QKD for critical communications?

3. **Competitive Positioning**: How does early quantum-safe adoption create sustainable
   competitive advantage in defense contracting?

4. **Technology Evolution**: What happens to this investment as quantum computing and
   quantum cryptography technologies mature?
