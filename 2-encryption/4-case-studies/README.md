# Module 2 Case Studies: Quantum vs Classical Security Decisions

Business scenarios where professionals must evaluate quantum cryptography vs post-quantum
classical approaches for long-term security requirements.

## Case Studies

- [Case Study 1: Government Communications Crisis at SecureGov Systems](./case-study-01.md)

  - **Challenge**: Foreign quantum computers broke RSA encryption for classified
    communications
  - **Decision**: QKD hybrid approach vs post-quantum cryptography for defense contracts
  - **Stakes**: $2B defense contracts, national security, DoD compliance requirements

- [Case Study 2: Healthcare Data Security at MedSecure Networks](./case-study-02.md)
  - **Challenge**: EU regulations require 50-year patient data confidentiality guarantees
  - **Decision**: Quantum-safe infrastructure vs regulatory compliance minimum
  - **Stakes**: â‚¬100M fines, patient privacy, competitive advantage in regulated markets

## Learning Objectives

Through these scenarios, you'll develop:

- **Long-term Security Planning**: Evaluate cryptographic approaches for 25+ year data
  protection requirements
- **Information-Theoretic vs Computational Security**: Understand fundamental differences
  in security models
- **Regulatory Compliance Strategy**: Navigate quantum-safe mandates and competitive
  implications
- **Investment Justification**: Quantify security improvements against implementation
  costs
- **Threat Model Analysis**: Assess nation-state and advanced persistent threat
  capabilities

## Key Decision Patterns

**When Quantum Cryptography is Justified**:

- Long-term confidentiality requirements (25+ years)
- Nation-state threat models with unlimited computing resources
- Regulatory mandates requiring physics-based security
- Critical infrastructure where security failure has systemic impact

**When Post-Quantum Classical Cryptography Suffices**:

- Standard business communications with shorter confidentiality periods
- Cost-sensitive applications where compliance minimum is acceptable
- Distributed systems where QKD infrastructure is impractical
- Applications requiring high throughput and low latency

## Strategic Insights

**Technology Evolution**: Quantum cryptography provides future-proof security that cannot
be broken by computational advances, unlike classical encryption which relies on
mathematical difficulty assumptions.

**Market Dynamics**: Early quantum-safe adoption creates competitive advantages in
regulated industries while late adoption risks market exclusion and regulatory penalties.

**Implementation Reality**: Hybrid approaches balance ultimate security (QKD) with
practical deployment constraints (post-quantum algorithms) for comprehensive protection
strategies.
