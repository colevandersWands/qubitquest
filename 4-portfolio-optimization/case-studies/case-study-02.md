## Business Context

**Company**: GlobalLogistics Corp - $5B supply chain management serving 10,000+ retailers
**Challenge**: Optimizing delivery routes across 50,000 locations with real-time
constraints **Complexity**: Weather, traffic, inventory levels, driver schedules, fuel
costs all change hourly **Impact**: $200M annual savings potential from optimal routing vs
current heuristic methods

## Current Classical Route Optimization

```
Daily Route Optimization Challenge:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Delivery Locations: 50,000 stores/warehouses           │
│ Variables: Route selection, timing, vehicle assignment │
│ Constraints: Driver hours, vehicle capacity, deadlines │
│ Current Method: Genetic algorithms + local search      │
│ Optimization Time: 8 hours for daily route planning   │
│ Solution Quality: 70% of theoretical optimal          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Business Pain Points**:

- **Suboptimal routes**: Current solutions 30% worse than optimal
- **Inflexibility**: 8-hour optimization prevents real-time route adjustments
- **Cost impact**: $200M annual excess transportation costs
- **Customer satisfaction**: Late deliveries due to inefficient routing

## The Combinatorial Optimization Problem

<details>
<summary><strong>Why Classical Methods Hit Scalability Walls</strong></summary>

**Problem Complexity**:

- **Route combinations**: 50,000! possible delivery sequences
- **Vehicle assignment**: 5,000 trucks × 50,000 locations optimization
- **Time windows**: Each delivery has preferred 2-hour window
- **Dynamic constraints**: Real-time traffic, weather, inventory changes

**Classical Optimization Limitations**:

```
Traveling Salesman Problem Scaling:
10 locations: 181,440 possible routes (solvable)
100 locations: 10^155 possible routes (computational limits)
50,000 locations: 10^213,000 possible routes (impossible)

Current Heuristic Performance:
- Genetic Algorithm: 70% optimal, 8-hour runtime
- Simulated Annealing: 65% optimal, 12-hour runtime
- Local Search: 60% optimal, 4-hour runtime
- Ant Colony: 68% optimal, 10-hour runtime
```

**Real-Time Requirements**:

- **Route recalculation**: Needed every 2 hours for traffic/weather changes
- **Emergency rerouting**: 15-minute response for vehicle breakdowns
- **Inventory-driven changes**: Routes adjust to stock-out situations
- **Customer requests**: Same-day delivery modifications

**Business Impact of Delayed Optimization**:

- **Fuel costs**: Suboptimal routes waste $50M annually in fuel
- **Driver overtime**: Poor scheduling creates $30M in excess labor costs
- **Customer penalties**: Late deliveries cost $20M in SLA violations
- **Competitive disadvantage**: Slower, more expensive than optimized competitors
