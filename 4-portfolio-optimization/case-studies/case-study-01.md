# Case Study 1: Real-Time Portfolio Optimization at QuantumAlpha Hedge Fund

## Business Context

**Company**: QuantumAlpha - $10B systematic hedge fund specializing in algorithmic trading
**Challenge**: Portfolio rebalancing takes 6 hours, missing intraday market opportunities
**Strategy**: 2,000 assets with complex constraints (risk, sector, liquidity, ESG)
**Performance Gap**: $100M annual alpha loss from stale allocations during volatile
markets

## Current Classical Optimization Infrastructure

```
Portfolio Optimization Pipeline:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Assets: 2,000 securities across global markets         │
│ Constraints: 50+ risk limits, sector caps, ESG scores  │
│ Solver: CPLEX mixed-integer programming                │
│ Hardware: 500 CPU cores, 2TB RAM                       │
│ Optimization Time: 6 hours for exact solution         │
│ Rebalancing Frequency: Once daily (overnight)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Performance Limitations**:

- **Combinatorial explosion**: 2^2000 possible portfolios
- **Constraint complexity**: 50+ interacting rules create solution bottlenecks
- **Market changes**: 6-hour optimization obsolete by completion during volatile periods
- **Opportunity cost**: $100M annual alpha from missed intraday rebalancing opportunities

## Market Volatility Challenge

<details>
<summary><strong>Why Static Daily Optimization Fails in Volatile Markets</strong></summary>

**Intraday Market Dynamics**:

- **News-driven volatility**: Earnings announcements, Fed decisions, geopolitical events
- **Correlation breakdown**: Historical relationships fail during crisis periods
- **Sector rotation**: Technology-to-value shifts happen within hours
- **Liquidity constraints**: Optimal portfolios become untradeable as markets move

**Lost Alpha Examples (2023)**:

- **Silicon Valley Bank crisis**: Optimal rebalancing 4 hours after news would have saved
  $50M
- **Fed pivot speculation**: Missing intraday momentum cost $30M in March
- **AI sector rotation**: 2-hour optimization window for tech rebalancing missed $20M
  opportunity

**Classical Optimization Response Time**:

```
Market Event Timeline:
Hour 0: Major news breaks (Fed announcement)
Hour 1: Volatility spike, correlations change
Hour 2: Optimal portfolio shifts significantly
Hour 3: Competition already rebalanced
Hour 6: Classical optimizer completes (too late)
Result: $10M+ opportunity cost per major event
```

**Business Impact**:

- **Alpha decay**: Every hour of delay reduces portfolio alpha by 15%
- **Risk exposure**: Stale allocations create unintended sector concentrations
- **Client retention**: Underperformance vs real-time competitors
- **Regulatory concern**: Portfolio drift beyond stated risk parameters

   or maintain them as proprietary advantage?

3. **Technology Evolution**: How should the firm prepare for competitors who also develop
   quantum optimization capabilities?

4. **Client Communication**: How would you explain quantum portfolio optimization benefits
   to institutional investors concerned about "black box" algorithms?
