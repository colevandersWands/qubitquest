# Quiz 5: Portfolio Optimization Business Decision

Your hedge fund spends $2M annually on optimization compute infrastructure. Quantum
optimization could reduce portfolio optimization time from 6 hours to 30 minutes but costs
$5M for infrastructure plus $1M annually.

Is this a good investment?

<details>
<summary><strong>A: No - the cost is too high for the speedup</strong></summary>

✖ Incomplete analysis.

While costs are higher, you need to consider the business value of faster optimization:
capturing more alpha, responding to market changes, reducing slippage costs.

Time-to-market often justifies premium infrastructure costs in finance.

<details>
<summary><strong>B: Yes - if faster optimization generates >$4M additional annual value</strong></summary>

✔ Correct!

Investment analysis: $5M upfront + $1M annual - $2M saved = $4M annual cost.

If 6-hour → 30-minute optimization enables capturing market opportunities worth >$4M
annually, the investment pays off.

In high-frequency markets, speed often generates value exceeding infrastructure costs.

<details>
<summary><strong>C: Wait for quantum costs to decrease</strong></summary>

✖ Poor timing strategy.

Waiting means continuing to lose potential alpha from slow optimization. Early adoption
provides competitive advantage before others access the technology.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>D: Only invest if quantum gives exact solutions</strong></summary>

✖ Misses the point.

In trading, approximate solutions delivered quickly often beat exact solutions delivered
slowly. Market opportunities disappear while perfect optimizers run.
