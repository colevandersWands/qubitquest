# Case Study 2: Cryptographic Key Search at CyberDefense Labs

## Business Context

**Company**: CyberDefense Labs - Government contractor providing cryptographic analysis
**Mission**: Test encryption strength by attempting to break symmetric keys **Challenge**:
AES-128 key search requires 2^128 operations classically **Contract Value**: $50M
government contract for cryptographic vulnerability assessment

## Current Classical Key Search Infrastructure

```
Distributed Key Search Operation:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Target: AES-128 bit symmetric keys                      │
│ Search Space: 2^128 ≈ 3.4 × 10^38 possible keys       │
│ Infrastructure: 100,000 specialized ASIC devices       │
│ Performance: 10^15 keys tested per second              │
│ Time to break: 3.4 × 10^23 seconds ≈ 10^16 years      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Business Reality**: Even with massive classical resources, AES-128 remains unbreakable
through brute force search.

## Quantum Search Analysis

**Grover's Algorithm Application**:

- **Classical complexity**: O(2^128) operations
- **Quantum complexity**: O(√2^128) = O(2^64) operations
- **Practical implication**: 2^64 ≈ 1.8 × 10^19 operations still impractical

**Quantum Resource Requirements**:

- **Logical qubits needed**: 128 qubits minimum for key space representation
- **Physical qubits needed**: ~1M qubits (assuming 1000:1 error correction overhead)
- **Circuit depth**: 2^64 quantum operations per key search
- **Coherence time**: Several hours of continuous quantum computation

**Time and Cost Analysis**:

```
Quantum Key Search Scenarios:

Optimistic Quantum Computer (2030):
- 10^6 logical qubits available
- 10^9 operations per second
- Time to break AES-128: 2^64 / 10^9 ≈ 500 years

Hypothetical Perfect Quantum Computer:
- Unlimited qubits, perfect error correction
- 10^12 operations per second
- Time to break AES-128: 2^64 / 10^12 ≈ 6 months

Reality Check:
- AES-256 remains secure even against quantum: 2^128 operations
- Symmetric encryption adapts by doubling key sizes
- Quantum advantage is limited, not magical
```

**Professional Conclusion**: Grover's algorithm reduces AES security but doesn't eliminate
it. This is why AES-256 is considered "quantum-safe."
