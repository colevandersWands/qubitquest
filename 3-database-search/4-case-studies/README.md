# Module 3 Case Studies: Quantum vs Classical Search Decisions

Business scenarios where professionals must evaluate quantum search vs classical parallel
approaches for large-scale unstructured data problems.

## Case Studies

- [Case Study 1: Fraud Detection at Scale - MegaBank's Search Challenge](./case-study-01.md)

  - **Challenge**: Real-time fraud detection across 10B daily transactions
  - **Decision**: Quantum search vs massive classical parallel infrastructure
  - **Stakes**: $2B fraud losses, regulatory compliance, competitive advantage

- [Case Study 2: Cryptographic Key Search at CyberDefense Labs](./case-study-02.md)
  - **Challenge**: Government contract for cryptographic vulnerability assessment
  - **Decision**: Quantum-enhanced cryptanalysis vs classical brute force methods
  - **Stakes**: $50M contracts, national security applications, market positioning

## Learning Objectives

Through these scenarios, you'll develop:

- **Complexity Analysis**: Understand when O(√N) quantum speedup beats O(N) classical
  search
- **Scale Assessment**: Identify problem sizes where quantum advantage becomes practical
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Compare quantum vs classical+parallel implementation costs
- **Market Timing**: Evaluate when to invest in quantum capabilities vs optimize classical
  systems
- **Hybrid Strategy Design**: Balance quantum advantages with practical deployment
  constraints

## Key Decision Patterns

**When Quantum Search is Justified**:

- Truly unstructured data (no indexing possible)
- Massive scale (>10^9 items) where √N speedup matters
- Real-time requirements that classical parallel can't meet
- Long-term competitive advantage worth high initial investment

**When Classical Search Remains Better**:

- Structured data with efficient indexing (O(log N) beats O(√N))
- Small to medium datasets where classical is fast enough
- Cost-sensitive applications where quantum overhead isn't justified
- Near-term requirements before quantum hardware matures

## Strategic Insights

**Problem Structure Matters**: The most important factor isn't data size but whether the
problem is truly unstructured vs indexable.

**Quantum Timeline**: Real quantum advantage for business applications likely 2030+ due to
hardware requirements and error correction needs.

**Hybrid Approaches**: Quantum-classical combinations provide near-term value while
building toward full quantum systems.
