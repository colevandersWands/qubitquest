# Module 1 Case Studies: Quantum vs Classical Randomness Decisions

Business scenarios where professionals must evaluate quantum RNG vs classical PRNG
trade-offs.

## Case Studies

- [Case Study 1: Regulatory Compliance Crisis at QuantumInvest](./case-study-01.md)

  - **Challenge**: SEC audit questioning PRNG quality in Monte Carlo risk models
  - **Decision**: Quantum RNG for regulatory compliance vs enhanced classical PRNGs
  - **Stakes**: $200M in potential fines, client trust, competitive advantage

- [Case Study 2: Cryptographic Security Breach at CyberShield Defense](./case-study-02.md)
  - **Challenge**: State-sponsored hackers predicted "random" encryption keys
  - **Decision**: Quantum RNG for information-theoretic security vs improved classical
    entropy
  - **Stakes**: $500M in liability claims, reputation damage, regulatory compliance

## Learning Objectives

Through these scenarios, you'll develop:

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Quantify trade-offs between quantum advantages and classical
  efficiency
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate security vulnerabilities of deterministic vs quantum
  randomness
- **Technology Decisions**: Make informed choices about quantum adoption in professional
  contexts
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Explain quantum concepts to technical and business
  audiences

## Key Decision Patterns

**When Quantum RNG is Justified**:

- Regulatory requirements for provable randomness
- Cryptographic security with information-theoretic guarantees
- Legal liability concerns about algorithmic bias
- Competitive advantage through superior security

**When Classical PRNG Remains Better**:

- High-throughput applications requiring speed
- Cost-sensitive applications with "good enough" quality
- Reproducible research requiring deterministic debugging
- Applications where predictability aids troubleshooting
