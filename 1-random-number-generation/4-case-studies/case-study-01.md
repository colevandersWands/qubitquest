## Business Context

**Company**: QuantumInvest - $15B asset management firm specializing in quantitative
strategies  
**Crisis**: SEC audit questioning randomness quality in Monte Carlo risk models  
**Regulatory Pressure**: Must demonstrate "statistically unbiased sampling" within 30
days  
**Stakes**: $200M in potential fines + reputational damage if models deemed inadequate  
**Professional Reality**: Your team must prove randomness meets regulatory standards

## The Regulatory Challenge

<details>
<summary><strong>SEC Audit Findings on Randomness Quality</strong></summary>

**Statistical Test Failures**:

- **Diehard test suite**: Failed 3 of 19 tests under extreme conditions
- **NIST randomness tests**: Minor patterns detected in tail scenarios
- **Runs test**: Slight serial correlation in rare event sequences
- **Birthday spacings**: Subtle clustering in high-dimensional scenarios

**Business Impact of PRNG Limitations**:

- **Bias accumulation**: 10M simulations amplify tiny PRNG biases
- **Predictability concerns**: Mersenne Twister state reconstructible from 624 outputs
- **Reproducibility vs. randomness**: Same seeds = same results (good for debugging, bad
  for true randomness)
- **Legal vulnerability**: Opposing counsel claims risk models are "deterministic, not
  random"

**Regulatory Requirements (New Guidelines)**:

- **Provable randomness**: Must demonstrate information-theoretic security
- **Independence**: Each random sample must be statistically independent
- **Non-predictability**: Future random values must be unpredictable from past values
- **Audit trail**: Complete documentation of randomness source and quality

**Competitive Intelligence**:

- **Goldman Sachs**: Rumored to be piloting quantum RNG for regulatory compliance
- **JP Morgan**: Published research on quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo methods
- **BlackRock**: Partnering with quantum computing companies for risk modeling
